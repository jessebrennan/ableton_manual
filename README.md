# ableton_manual
This script downloads abletons manual and prepares it to be converted to epub by calibre

## Edit by Jesse

@martinfinke's instructions might be difficult to follow for a newbie so I went ahead 
and generated the epub for you. 

I did it for live 10 and may try again with live 11 when it's released in a couple weeks.

I hope you find this useful.

## To download the EPUB

Click the epub from the list of files above or...

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/jessebrennan/ableton_manual/releases/tag/10.1.30).
